# Bayesian Ecological Modelling workshop

### Charles Darwin University and the Northern Territory Government, 16-18 April 2019

This GitHub site contains materials for a workshop on Bayesian Ecological Modelling, taught by [Nick Golding](https://github.com/goldingn) and [Saras Windecker](https://github.com/smwindecker).

Scroll down for the schedule and instructions.

[Here's a link](https://chi-feng.github.io/mcmc-demo/app.html) to a cool interactive illustration of different MCMC algorithms fare on different types of posterior distribution.

## Schedule

This schedule is deliberately light on details - we'll introduce Bayesian theory and practical issues, and cover lots of example models in the *Examples and Exercises* sections. We have lots of examples to choose from and plan to adapt (and add to) these depending on the interests and experience of the participants.

### Tuesday 16th

##### 08.30-09.00 **Introductions and setup**

##### 09.00-10.30 **Introduction to Bayes**

##### 10.30-11.00 **Break**

### Wednesday 17th

##### 08.30-09.00 **Feedback on content**

##### 10.30-11.00 **Break**

### Thursday 18th

##### 08.30-09.00 **Feedback on content**

##### 09.00-10.30 **BYO modelling problems**

##### 10.30-11.00 **Break**

##### 11.00-12.30ish **BYO modelling problems**

On the latter two mornings, there's alotted time for participants to feed back on which issues aren't clear, and what topics we should cover. Some possible topics are: imperfect detection, survival analysis, hierarchical modelling, and other Bayesian modelling software (Stan, INLA). Please let us know if those, or anything else, are of interest!

## Course set-up

The course will be taught in R, using R notebooks, and with Bayesian models in greta. To simplify set-up, we will be teaching the course inside the RStudio Cloud environment. This means that all required packages and software versions will be pre-installed.

### using R notebooks

We have provided a number of R notebooks to run models. R notebooks let you mix comments, code, and outputs (including figures) in a single document. [Here's a guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) in case you haven't used an R notebook before.

## Local computer

If you'd like to download these resources onto your local computer, you can view all these files on [GitHub](http://github.com/smwindecker/bayes_ecology_course), or download them directly [here](https://github.com/smwindecker/bayes_ecology_course/archive/master.zip). 

To use the R notebooks, you'll need to have the `rmarkdown` package installed, and use RStudio as your interface to R.

You can install `rmarkdown` from within R with the following command:

```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

You can install the latest RStudio for your system from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
